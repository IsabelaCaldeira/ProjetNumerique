# Physics with Python :woman_technologist: :blue_heart:

In this project, we aim to use Python and Jupyter Notebook to solve physics problems!

## Getting Started

This project helps you get familiar with Jupyter Notebook and the libraries `matplotlib` and `numpy`. You'll learn how to process data and represent it graphically.

## Objectives

- Apply physics formulas in Python code.
- Implement functions to solve physics problems.
- Understand the impact of computer science in the field of physics.
